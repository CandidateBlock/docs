Introduction
============

``CandidateBlock Documentation`` is a complementary resource to the `CandidateBlock Bitcoin Library <https://candidateblock-bitcoin-library.readthedocs.io/>`_ Python package.
The aim is to give the reader some background knowledge to build whilst exploring the Bitcoin Protocol.

We will start with an explanation of number systems and how to convert between them, with Python examples.

Move on to how computers store numbers in memory.

And then discuss some topics required to understand the ``Bitcoin Protocol`` including cryptography and hash functions.

Motivation
**********

As experimenters and hobbyist in the field of Bitcoin, we wanted to write some supporting documentation to the Python package.
